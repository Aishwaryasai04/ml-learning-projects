Introduction to Machine Learning

What is Machine Learning:
ML is an application of AI which enables a program or software to learn form the experiences and improve their self at a task without being explicitly programmed.

It is all about feeding the data and enabling the software to identify certain things

For example:
How would you write a program that can identify the fruit based on its color, shape, size or any other property?

It identifies if the fruit such as banana or apples based on the photo data that is fed into it.
