Unsupervised Machine Learning:

Those algorithms that are not clear or there is not supervising task.
It doesnt have a label to go forward.

-->Clustering: This means bundling the input variables with the same characteristics together.
example: grouping users based on search history

-->Association:
Here, we discover the rules that govern meaningful associations among the data set. 
example: People who watch X will also watch Y
People who bought candy also bought hot items.

First use supervised learning to find the label and use unsupervised learning to use the label

It is used to build the applications.
