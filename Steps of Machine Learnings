7 Steps of Machine Learning

1. Gathering Data:
Gathering of pictures of fruits, weather data etc.

2. Preparing that Data:
Make the data suitable. Like telling the data that is banana to the picture that has to be identified. It simply is assigning the data to an object.

3. Choosing a Model:

It is a way to translate the certain features of data to certain parts of output that is desired

4. Training:

It is a process to train the model.
For example: What attributes of banana can be trained to make sure the model identifies it.

5. Evaluation:
ML algorithm undergoes an examination to make sure it is giving desired output

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Even if the exam is passed, some tweaks are made. Tuning the model.

7. Prediction:

Deployment the model. Put it to use
